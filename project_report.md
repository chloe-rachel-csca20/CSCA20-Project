## Project Plan

--------

### Project Title: Weather Checker

### Description

We will write a Python code that returns weather data of a specific date. 
The code will consist of multiple functions and importing database files.
We might also try to find a way to graph the averages.
It will be able to return:
- daily temperature and precipitation
- average temperature and precipitation in the next 7 days
- weather description and recommended clothing 

### Week 1 Plan

**Before** the first tutorial will have:

- Find a good weather database online:
- Write down a list of functions that we need

**After** the first tutorial will have:

- Writing up all required functions with docstrings:
  - Read csv file
  - Get daily maximum and minimum temperature values
  - Get daily precipitation value
  - Calculate mean temperature of the day
        - Calculate the average temperature in the next 7 days
  - Calculate average precipitation
  - Get daily weather description and clothing suggestion 

What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?

- Consult TA or professor for other possibilities of writing the code and maybe focus on the reply functions first
- Not implementing the graphing function
